## Directory content
- `encoding-ok.mlw`: a Why3 file containing the proofs.
- `encoding-ok/`: a directory generated by Why3 that keeps traces of the performed proofs, in particular the Coq proofs.
- `Dockerfile`: used to build the Docker image and listing the dependencies.

## Dependencies
Why3, Coq, CVC5, Z3, and Alt-Ergo.  
For version numbers, please refer to the `Dockerfile`.

## Replaying the proofs
### Command line
`why3 replay encoding-ok` will replay the proof.

### Why3 IDE
`why3 ide encoding-ok.mlw` will launch the Why3 IDE with all proofs completed.

1. **Forget the proofs**  
   `Tool → Mark obsolete`

2. **Replay all proofs**  
   `Tool → Replay valid obsolete proofs`
   
## Docker
A docker is available here : https://cloud.irit.fr/s/oXYNl0dxqZZpcb4

Load the docker with `docker load -i fase_why3.tar`

Run the docker with `docker run --rm -it fase_why3 bash`

You will then be able to run the `why3 replay encoding-ok` to replay the proof. Using the Why3 IDE can be more difficult due to issues with the connection between the graphical server and Docker.

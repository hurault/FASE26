To obtain the same results as those reported in Table 4 of the paper (see the Experiments directory), a machine at least as powerful as the one used in our experiments will be required, namely: Dell Inc. Precision 3591 with 32 GiB of RAM and Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 165H × 22, running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (64 bits).
